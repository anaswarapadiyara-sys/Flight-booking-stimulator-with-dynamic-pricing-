        <h1>We manage your trip, so you can live the destination.</h1>

        <p>Back in the 90s, booking a ticket meant going all the way to the airport and standing in long queues.</p>
        <p>Travel has become more affordable, but the experience is still chaotic and uncertain.</p>
        <p>This happens due to lack of proper information reaching travelers at the right time.</p>
        <p>We built Blinctrip — your personal travel assistant — to solve this.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to help you have a great trip every time.</p>
